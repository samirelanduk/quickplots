Installing
----------

pip
~~~

quickplots can be installed using pip:

``$ pip install quickplots``

quickplots is written for Python 3. If the above installation fails, it may be
that your system uses ``pip`` for the Python 2 version - if so, try:

``$ pip3 install quickplots``

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

quickplots relies on `OmniCanvas <http://omnicanvas.samireland.com/>`_ for its
graphics capabilities. If you install quickplots using pip this library will be
installed automatically. It also requires
`numerus <http://numerus.samireland.com/>`_.

Otherwise quickplots has no external dependencies, and is pure Python.
