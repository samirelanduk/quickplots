Creating Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The easiest way to create a chart is with the quick-add functions. For example,
the following code would create a line chart of the sine function:

  >>> import quickplots
  >>> from math import sin, radians
  >>> data = [(x, sin(radians(x))) for x in range(360)]
  >>> chart = quickplots.line(*data, color="#0000FF", title="sin(x)")
  >>> chart.x_label("angle")
  >>> chart.y_label("sine of angle")

A few things to note here. The :py:func:`.line` function takes (x, y) data points as its
positional arguments - these can be lists or tuples. All arguments that are not
data must be given as keyword arguments.

As with all other quickplots functions that accept data in this way, you can
also provide the data in the form of two lists (or tuples) - one of all the x
values and one of all the y values:

  >>> chart = quickplots.line([x for x in range(360)], [sin(radians(x)) for x in range(360)])

Line charts
###########

Use the :py:func:`.line` function as above to create line charts. You can pass
in hex colors to the ``color`` function and line styles (see the full
documentation for a full list of styles) to the ``linestyle`` argument.

Charts themselves also have a :func:`~charts.AxisChart.line` method for adding new line series. To
add the cosine function to the above chart, you would do the following:

  >>> cosine_data = [(x, cos(radians(x))) for x in range(360)]
  >>> chart.line(*cosine_data, color="#00FF00")

Modifying Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Charts have a title, an x axis label, and a y axis label, which can be modified
like so:

  >>> chart.title()
  'sin(x)'
  >>> chart.title("A new title")
  >>> chart.title()
  'A new title'
  >>> chart.x_label("A new x-axis label")
  >>> chart.y_label("A new y-axis label")

Charts can have one or more :py:class:`.Series` objects. The ``series`` property
will return the first series, and the ``all_series`` will return all the
series on the chart.

See the documentation for :py:class:`.Chart` and :py:class:`.AxisChart` for
more information.

Outputting Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All charts have a :func:`~charts.AxisChart.create` method which will create an
OmniCanvas `canvas <https://omnicanvas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/canvas.htm\
l#omnicanvas.canvas.Canvas>`_ with the chart painted to it. These can be saved
or rendered as SVG text.

  >>> chart.create()
  <Canvas 700Ã—500 (7 Graphics)>
  >>> chart.create().save("Charts.svg")
